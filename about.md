<h2>Programming skills</h2><br>
<p>Most of my programming is done in Python, both professionally and personally. I enjoy programming in my own time. A particular interest of mine is in sports betting. In football I have developed my own expected goals (xG) model using historical shot-location data in the Premier League and a simple neural network to predict the chance of a goal given a particular shot. In a more experimental project I use a multi-layer perceptron, implemented in Tensorflow, to predict the odds of a premier league match based on the Fifa player ratings of the starting XI. I have also experimented with other neural network architectures, such as a GAN for generating Fortnite skins and a DQN which I trained to play Bug on a Wire (an online flash game). My final year BSc project was completed solely in R, giving me experience of this language and my MRes project was in Python with a significant amount of Tensorflow. I also have good experience with C, C++ and Maple from my undergraduate degree. Other software I have experience with include Tensorflow, PyTorch, matplotlib, scikit-learn, pandas, git, Flask, AWS, Spark, Hadoop and PostgreSQL. All of the above mentioned projects can be found on my GitHub - https://github.com/BradleyGrantham.</p>


<h2>Hobbies and interests</h2><br>
<p>I have always enjoyed playing golf and have a handicap of 6, although I donâ€™t get to play as frequently in London as I used to. I have played football since I was 6 and continued to play all throughout university as well as 5-a- side matches whenever possible. I also enjoy tennis, running and cycling and recently completed RideLondon. Furthermore, I have been a regular skier since the age of 5.</p>
